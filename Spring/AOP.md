### Spring AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming)
- AOP breaks the program logic into distinct parts (called concerns). It is used to increase modularity by cross-cutting concern.
- A cross-cutting concern is a concern that can affect the whole application and should be centralized in one location in code as possible, such as transaction management,
  authentication, logging, security etc.

### Why AOP?
- It provides the pluggable way to dynamically add the additional concern before, after or around the actual logic.
